Feature: Adding items to cart

  Rule: Items added from the catalog page should appear in the cart
    Example: Colin adds some items to his cart
      Given Colin has logged on to the application
      And he is browsing the catalog
      When he adds the following items to the cart:
      |Sauce Labs Backpack|
      |Sauce Labs Bike Light|
      Then the shopping cart count should be 2
      And the items should appear in the cart
